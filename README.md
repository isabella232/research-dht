# DHT Research Group

> Analytical, Research and development effort to diagnose performance problems within libp2p DHT protocol(s) and, eventually, fix them.

## Responsibilities include

- Analyzing the state of the existing IPFS peer network
- Improving diagnostic capabilities of libp2p and associated tooling
- Improving the state of IPTB to better support DHT network simulations
- Improving performance of DHT implementations
- Establishing testing infrastructure for DHT regressions
